		* RPMFusion repositories enabled by default
			* Including drivers for video watching, i.e. Netflix
		* Destler singles sample music
	* bootable
		* do we want encryption? - Could it be difficult or confusing for a new user to set this up, or if they forget the encryption passphrase, will they understand that they won't be able to recover their system *at all*?
			* Definitely add option.
		* Maybe something to add to the wiki/documentation and make it easy for them to do later
	* User experience (i.e. "I've never used Linux before, what am I doing and where am I?")

			* Add to wiki how to install other DEs if they want
		* Browser flexibiity: Including Firefox (already included) and Chromium from first install
			* Nonfree plugins (Netflix, Flash) for functionality and convenience
			* DuckDuckGo: Search engine by default (is this possible in either Firefox or Chromium configuration files?????)
				* If people want google we can put in the documentation how to switch to google and why we use DuckDuckGo as a default and we can include a link to the wiki in the default homepage
